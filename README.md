- 👋 Hi, I’m Rick Young, a FullStack Developer from China 🇨🇳. 
- 👀 I’m interested in music🎵, pets🐱, boxing👊🏻, etc.. (Too much)

![Computer Cat — hazzart](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ccdb6eeb91449580563d995/1585071507659-79IGQEUKOLMRHVKV3NS8/ComputerCat_06.gif?format=2500w)

In this profile, you probably can find:
- Personal work for assigments and projects of some CS courses. (ah, hope it is legal)
- Some personal projects include frontend (React, angular..), backend. 
- Some group projects in hackathon.
- (In the future) Personal Cookbook 🍚 （Written in Chinese since most of them are Chinese food)

Peace and Love 💝. （Meanwhile, stay hungry, stay foolish. )
