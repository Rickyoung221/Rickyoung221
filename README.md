In this profile, you probably can find:
- Personal work for assigments and projects of some CS courses. (ah, hope it is legal)
- Some personal projects include frontend (React, angular..), backend. 
- Some group projects in hackathon.
- (In the future) Personal Cookbook 🍚 （Written in Chinese since most of them are Chinese food)

Peace and Love 💝. （Meanwhile, stay hungry, stay foolish. )
