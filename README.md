- 👋 Hi, I’m Rick Young, a FullStack Developer from China 🇨🇳. 
- 👀 I’m interested in music🎵, pets🐱, boxing👊🏻, etc.. (Too much)

In this profile, you probably can find:
- Personal work for assigments and projects of some CS courses. (ah, hope it is legal)
- Some personal projects include frontend (React, angular..), backend.
- (In the future) Personal Cookbook 🍚 （Written in Chinese since most of them are Chinese food)
- Some group projects in hackathon.

Peace and Love 💝. （Meanwhile, stay hungry, stay foolish. )
